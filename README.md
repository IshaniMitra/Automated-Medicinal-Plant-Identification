# Herbal AI : Automated-Medicinal-Plant-Identification

# ABSTRACT: 
The proper identification of plant species has major benefits for a wide range of stakeholders ranging from forestry services, botanists, taxonomists, physicians, pharmaceutical laboratories, organizations fighting for endangered species, government and the public at large. Consequently, this has fueled an interest in developing automated systems for the recognition of different plant species. A fully automated method for the recognition of medicinal plants using computer vision and machine learning techniques has been presented. In this project we explore feature vectors from both the front and back side of a green leaf along with morphological features to arrive at aunique optimum combination of features that maximizes the identification rate. A database of medicinal plant leaves is created from scanned images of front and back side of leaves of commonly used medicinal plants. Leaves from different medicinal plant species were collected and photographed using a webcam in a laboratory setting. A large number of features were extracted from each leaf such as its length, width, perimeter, area, number of vertices, color, perimeter and area of hull. Several derived features were then computed from these attributes.  The best results were obtained from a random forest classifier using a 10-fold cross-validation technique. With an accuracy of 90.1%, the random forest classifier performed better than other machine learning approaches such as the k-nearest neighbor, na√Øve Bayes, support vector machines and neural networks. These results are very encouraging and future work will be geared towards using a larger dataset and high-performance computing facilities to investigate the performance of deep learning neural networks to identify medicinal plants used in primary health care. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first of its kind to have created a unique image dataset for medicinal plants.  It is anticipated that a web-based or mobile computer system for the automatic recognition of medicinal plants will help the local population to improve their knowledge on medicinal plants, help taxonomists to develop more efficient species identification techniques and will also contribute significantly in the protection of endangered species.

# INTRODUCTION
The world bears thousands of plant species, many of which have medicinal values, others are close to extinction, and still others that are harmful to man. Not only are plants an essential resource for human beings, but they form the base of all food chains. The medicinal plants are used mostly in herbal, ayurvedic and folk medicinal manufacturing. Herbal plants are plants that can be used for alternatives to cure diseases naturally. About 80% of people in the world still depend on traditional medicine. Meanwhile, according to herbal plants are plants whose plant parts (leaves, stems, or roots) have properties that can be used as raw materials in making modern medicines or traditional medicines. These medicinal plants are often found in the forest. There are various types of herbal plants that we can know through the identification of these herbs, one of which is using identification through the leaves. and protect plant species, it is crucial to study and classify plants correctly. Combinations of a small subset amounting to 1500 of these plants are used in Herbal medicines of different systems of India. Specifically, commercial Ayurvedic preparations use 500 of these plants. Over 80% of plants used in ayurvedic formulations are collected from the forests and wastelands whereas the remaining are cultivated in agricultural lands. More than 8000 plants of Indian origin have been found to be of medicinal value.

# PROBLEM DEFINITION

To address these challenges, there is a pressing need for an automated system that can accurately and efficiently identify medicinal plants based on their visual characteristics. Leveraging advancements in deep learning and machine learning techniques, this study aims to develop a robust and scalable solution for automated medicinal plant identification. The primary objective is to create a model that can analyze plant images, extract discriminative features, and classify medicinal plant species accurately and rapidly, thereby mitigating the limitations of manual identification methods.By employing a combination of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and machine learning algorithms for classification, this research seeks to create a hybrid system capable of revolutionizing the identification process.

  # Data Collection and Preprocessing: A Foundation for Success:
  The journey begins with the acquisition of a diverse dataset, a digital compendium encapsulating the visual diversity of various medicinal plants. Encompassing different species and plant parts such as leaves, 
  flowers, and roots, this dataset becomes the backbone of the subsequent model development. The manual annotation of this dataset with accurate information on plant species or medicinal parts lays thegroundwork 
  for supervised learning, ensuring that the model learns from a labelled dataset.Data preprocessing, a critical phase in the machine learning pipeline, involves the curation of the dataset to enhance its

# CONCLUSION:
In this study, a deep-learning-based system was proposed to perform a real-time species identification of medicinal plants found in the Borneo region. The proposed system addressed some of the key challenges when training deep learning models, such as small training samples with long-tile class imbalance distribution of the species data. Techniques such as class weighting and the use of focal loss function were applied to improve the learning process of the model. The results showed that the proposed system could significantly improve the performance of the deep learning model by more than 10% accuracy compared to the baseline model. However, performance accuracy was slightly dropped when the system was tested on the actual samples by using the developed mobile application in real time. In the future, we intend to further improve the system‚Äôs performance by improving the sample collection of the training data. Furthermore, to make the system more useful, we intend to increase the number of species, as the Borneo region is a high species diversity spot.

In this paper we have implemented a technique for medicinal plant identification using random forest algorithm, an ensemble supervises machine learning algorithm based on color, texture and geometrical features to identify the correct species of medicinal plant. The combination of shape, color and texture features result in correct leaf identification accuracy of 94.54 %. The results shown in this technique are very promising and thus indicate the aptness of this algorithm for medicinal plant identification systems. this work can be extended to a larger number of Plants species with improved accuracy in future.
